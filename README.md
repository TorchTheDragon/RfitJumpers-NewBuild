# Rift Jumpers Features

 - **Custom Notes**
	 - So far, there are [a few custom notes](#custom-note-list) to both damage and heal the player.
	 - To use these notes in the chart editor, press numbers 1 or 2 on the numpad (make sure numlock is on) and click where you want the note to hit. 
	 - Currently does nothing to the enemies, only to the player.
	 - To read more, go [here](notes/Torch'sNotes.txt)
 - **Custom Noteskins per Character**
	 - Well, although this isn't true yet, the code to do so is in the repository.
 - **Animated Healthbar Icons**
	 - Again, although this isn't fully true yet, the code is there to do so.
 - **Animated Event Icons**
	 - Code is there and working (I used BF losing icon for testing), the only note that affects this is the first custom note, the flame/burning note.

## Custom Note List
 - Burning Notes
 - Instant Kill Notes
 - Heal Notes
 - Slow Heal Notes
 - Hide Notes (A note that when hit, hides notes for a few seconds)
 - Text Popup Sequence (Similar to Lullaby Unown Event)
 - (Placeholder Text)

## Kade Engine
**Kade Engine** is a mod for Friday Night Funkin', including a full engine rework, replays, and more.

# Kade Engine Features

 - **New Input System**
	 - An improved input system, similar to Quaver or Etterna, with less delays, less dropped inputs and other improvements.
 - **More information during gameplay**
	 - While you're playing, we show you information about how you're doing, such as your accuracy, combo break count, notes per second, and your grade/rating.
 - **Customizable keybinds**
	 - Instead of being forced to use WASD and the arrow keys, you can set any keybinds you want!
 - **Replays** (in beta)
	 - Have you ever gotten a crazy score but didn't record? The replay system solves that: it automatically saves a "replay" of your gameplay every time you complete a song, which you can play back inside of the game. 
	 - Replays just store information about what you're doing, they don't actually record the screen -- so they take up way less space on your disk than videos.
 - **Audio offset**
	 - If your speakers or headphones are delayed, you can set an offset in the options menu to line the game up with the delay and play with synced audio like intended!
 - **And much, much more!**
	 - There's so much more in store than just what's listed here! If you can imagine a quality of life feature, it's probably
	 either already included in Kade Engine or is being worked on!
